# Detecting-Fake-News-with-ML
This project implements a machine learning model to detect fake news using Python. The project utilizes a political dataset and explores various techniques for feature extraction and model training.

**Key Techniques:**

TfidfVectorizer: Transforms textual data into numerical features based on word frequency and importance.
PassiveAggressiveClassifier: A linear classifier suitable for large datasets and online learning.
Accuracy of 92.74%: Demonstrates the effectiveness of the model in identifying fake news.

**Potential Applications:**

Social media platforms: Filter and flag potentially false information.
News websites: Identify and remove fake news articles.
Research and analysis: Analyze trends in fake news dissemination.
**Future Work:**

Explore other feature engineering techniques
Experiment with different classification algorithms
Implement ensemble methods for improved accuracy
Build a web application for real-time fake news detection
